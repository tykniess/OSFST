OSFST is a finite-state transducer for the Old Saxon language, built on the framework of Helsinki Finite-State Technologies (HFST) using KÃ¶bler's Old Saxon Dictionary. Current output forms are in forms.txt, while information about corpus coverage is in coverage.txt. 
This project was originally titled Muspilli. That legacy project is still on Github but is not being updated.
